// This challenge is part of a tutorial track by MyCodeSchool

// Youâ€™re given the pointer to the head node of a linked list and a specific position. Counting backwards from the tail node of the linked list, get the value of the node at the given position. A position of 0 corresponds to the tail, 1 corresponds to the node before the tail and so on.

// Input Format

// You have to complete the int getNode(SinglyLinkedListNode* head, int positionFromTail) method which takes two arguments - the head of the linked list and the position of the node from the tail. positionFromTail will be at least 0 and less than the number of nodes in the list. You should NOT read any input from stdin/console.

// The first line will contain an integer , the number of test cases. 
// Each test case has the following format: 
// The first line contains an integer , the number of elements in the linked list. 
// The next  lines contains, an element each denoting the element of the linked list. 
// The last line contains an integer  denoting the position from the tail, whose value needs to be found out and returned.

// Constraints

// , where  is the  element of the linked list.
// Output Format

// Find the node at the given position counting backwards from the tail. Then return the data contained in this node. Do NOT print anything to stdout/console.

// The code in the editor handles output. 
// For each test case, print the value of the node, each in a new line.
    // Complete the getNode function below.
